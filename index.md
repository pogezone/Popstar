Popstar  Privacy Policy
Popstar  ("Popstar " or "we") is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our online users ("users" or "you"). This Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") has been crafted to inform you as to the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide in connection with any Popstar  game or application ("Service"). Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to only information collected from Popstar  through use of the Service.
By using the Service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and we encourage you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.

Information Collected and Used
Popstar 's primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the Service.

(2) Facebook user identification number, 
(3) or email address. 

Additionally, we may acquire information from you through: 
(1) your access and participation in message boards on the Service 
(2) your email of a question to our customer support or 
(3) your purchase of a virtual product of any type. Please note that because a third party site manages the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, we do not have access to your credit card details and billing information.

If non-personal information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, Popstar  may combine your non-personal information with your personal information in an attempt to provide you with a better user experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze how our Service is used.

The Service will also record game play information such as your high scores or game session duration.

In addition to information collected as described above, you may choose to share additional information about yourself throughout the Service, such as in games or on message boards. Any action you perform with other players are considered public, and are your sole discretion.

Finally, any time you access the Service, we may collect aggregate information including but not limited to internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity. We use this information to better tailor the Service to your interests, to provide you more efficient customer support, and to overall enhance the Service.
